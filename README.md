# About the Project
The Campus Life Perspectives project is a collaboration with [DTU Campus Service](https://www.dtu.dk/om-dtu/organisation/administration/campus_service), [ERIK Architects](https://www.erik.dk/), [The Techno-Anthropology Lab](https://www.tantlab.aau.dk/) as well as [Polyteknisk Forening](https://www.pf.dk/) - and is part of [our](link) thesis project in Techno-Anthropology at Aalborg University Copenhagen. The project builds on an app developed in the [Urban Belonging Project](https://urbanbelonging.com/en) and aims to test it as a new, more participatory and data driven way of evaluating buildings and urban areas - in this case Lyngby Campus. By participating, you get a chance to voice your opinions and share experiences on life at Lyngby Campus - and hopefully help make campus a better place. The data collection part of the project will run during September, and any insights produced will be made available to our project partners. It doesnâ€™t matter if you're just starting at university, are about to finish or if you are just visiting for a the semester - your insights are valuable to us and the [Campus Renewal Project!](https://campusudvikling.dtu.dk/)

# The Themes
To instrumentalize the overarching question, it has been split up into three thematic groups, which each have a concrete task we want participants to do.

### Social Life
With this theme, we take interest in where you go to be social, connect or just hang out on campus, outside of formal study activities. 

- _What is a good meeting spot?_
- _What is a good place to hang out?_
- _Where do you often run into people you know?_
- _Where do you feel at home on campus?_

### Study Activities
This theme is about the places around Lyngby Campus (inside or outside) you find is good for studying.

- _What is a good place to study?_
- _Where do you feel most productive?_
- _Where do you like to do group work?_
- _What is your favorite auditorium?_    

### Motivation & Inspiration
This theme is about what parts of campus elicit feelings of inspiration or motivation. This could be because of one of the many laboratories around campus or any other reasons you feel inspired.

- _Where do you feel inspired and/or motivated?_
- _Where is research most visible to you?_
- _Where do you feel an academic sense of belonging?_

# Follow-up Survey
The aim of the survey is to get information about participants affiliation to DTU.
- _What is your study programme?_
- _What semester are you on?_
- _Are you and expat?_
